This project is a python script that translates subtitle files(.srt) using the deepl translator. It can be used as a command line tool.
The dunkirkxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.srt holds the full subtitles of the movie Dunkirk, smaller.srt holds a 25 frame version I used for testing,
and dunkirkinSPANISH.srt holds the translated version of smaller.srt. 
Probably should have named the project subtitle-translator.
