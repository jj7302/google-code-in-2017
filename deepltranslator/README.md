-This project is a python script that translates subtitle files(.srt) using the deepl translator. It can be used as a command line tool.
The dunkirkxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.srt holds the full subtitles of the movie Dunkirk, smaller.srt holds a 25 frame version I used for testing,
and dunkirkinSPANISH.srt holds the translated version of smaller.srt. 
Probably should have named the project subtitle-translator.
For command line usage: -in specifies the input srt file, -out specifies the output srt file, -source specifies the source language, -target specifies the target language. fullTranslationInSpanish.srt holds the full version of the subtitles translated.
