2
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,867
¡Soy inglés! 

3
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,653
Sabes que soy inglés. Son granaderos, amigo. Este es el fin. De ninguna manera 

4
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,941
es una locura. ¡Abran 

5
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,569
paso! ¡Fuera del camino! 

6
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,447
Vamos, vamos, vamos. 

7
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,230
Along the mole. All the way.

8
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,985
The ship's about to leave.

9
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,841
Along the mole. All the way.
The ship's about to leave.

10
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,634
Where's the bloody air force?

11
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:37,241
The navy's requisitioned her.

12
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:40,375
They'll be back in an hour.
My dad wants to be ready before then.

13
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,399
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

14
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,568
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

15
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,614
Some men?

16
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,885
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

17
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,366
70 gallons.

18
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,679
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

19
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,812
Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel

20
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,485
for 40-minute fighting
time over Dunkirk.

21
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,385
Understood. Vector
128, angels point five.

22
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:34,615
And keep an eye on that gauge,
even when it gets lively.

23
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,534
Save enough to get back.

24
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,969
No French soldiers.
No French soldiers. No.
