2
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,867
English! I'm English!

3
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,653
It's grenadiers, mate.

4
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,941
Make way!

5
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,569
Out of the way!

6
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,447
Go, go, go!

7
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,230
Along the mole. All the way.

8
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,985
The ship's about to leave.

9
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,841
Along the mole. All the way.
The ship's about to leave.

10
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,634
Where's the bloody air force?

11
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:37,241
The navy's requisitioned her.

12
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:40,375
They'll be back in an hour.
My dad wants to be ready before then.

13
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,399
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

14
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,568
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

15
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,614
Some men?

16
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,885
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

17
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,366
70 gallons.

18
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,679
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

19
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,812
Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel

20
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,485
for 40-minute fighting
time over Dunkirk.

21
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,385
Understood. Vector
128, angels point five.

22
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:34,615
And keep an eye on that gauge,
even when it gets lively.

23
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,534
Save enough to get back.

24
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,969
No French soldiers.
No French soldiers. No.

25
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:52,735
No, no French. English only.
English only past this point.

26
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,321
No. It's a British ship.
No, you have your own ships.

27
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,072
Get back. Get back.

28
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,365
No, you've got your own
ships. This is a British ship.

29
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,868
No, get back.

30
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,106
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.

31
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,080
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

32
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,207
Go, go, go. Along the mole. All the way.

33
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,554
The ship's about to
leave. About to leave.

34
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:12,004
Along the mole. All the way.

35
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,505
Along the mole. Along the
mole. All the way. All the way.

36
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,673
No.

37
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,469
No, English only. English only!

38
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,538
No!

39
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,365
Ready on the stern!

40
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,368
Yes, sir!

41
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,294
Man the bowline!

42
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,715
Any more room?

43
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:04,139
You have to get back!

44
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,440
That's two minutes.

45
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,609
You've missed it. You've missed it.

46
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,179
Is that the last one?

47
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,267
Aye, sir.

48
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,601
Break the line.

49
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,400
Come on! Come on!

50
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,500
Dunkirk's so far. Why can't
they just load at Calais?

51
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,004
The enemy had something to say about it.

52
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,695
Ah, down here we're sitting ducks.

53
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:04,325
Keep 'em peeled. They'll
come out of the sun.

54
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:18,365
Up the line.

55
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,403
Oi. We'll take it.

56
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,322
Drop the gangplank!

57
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,326
Yes, sir!

58
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,760
Take a run at it.

59
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,543
Ready on the stern line, George.

60
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,725
Aren't you waiting on the navy?

61
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:24,172
They've asked for the
Moonstone, they'll have her.

62
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,548
And her captain.

63
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,720
And his son.

64
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:31,888
Thanks for the help, George.

65
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,184
What are you doing?

66
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,386
You do know where we're going?

67
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,265
France.

68
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,153
Into war, George.

69
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,404
I'll be useful, sir.

70
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,456
Bandit, 11 o'clock.

71
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,667
Break.

72
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,222
He's on me.

73
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,894
I'm on him.

74
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:55,263
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

75
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,472
Oi, you two.

76
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,809
Get a shift on.

77
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,520
Yeah, pull him tight. Tie a knot in it.

78
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,605
Back up the line. Both of you.

79
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,191
Off you go.

80
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,526
Off you go!

81
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,194
That last barrage has
damaged the rudder.

82
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,396
Uh, okay...

83
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,068
Psst!

84
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,943
Mr. Dawson!

85
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,322
One of ours, George.

86
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,922
On my mark, Fortis 2. Draw him left.

87
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:09,146
Three, two, one.

88
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,192
Mark.

89
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,540
Clear.

90
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,671
Is he down?

91
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,595
Yeah, he's down for the count.

92
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,069
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.

93
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,819
Fortis Leader, do you read?

94
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:04,451
Fortis 2, I have you to my port. I
have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.

95
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,625
Understood, Fortis 1.

96
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:08,044
Orbit for a look.

97
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,304
How long, Lieutenant?

98
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,344
We need to run a new cable,
sir. They're scrambling.

99
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:26,640
Very well.

100
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,732
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

101
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,484
One stretcher takes the
space of seven standing men.

102
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,572
Excuse me.

103
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:55,077
- Rear Admiral.
- Commander.

104
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,839
How's the perimeter?

105
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,799
Shrinking every day.

106
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,095
But between our rear guard and
the French, we're holding the line.

107
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,096
And the enemy tanks have stopped.

108
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,616
Why have they stopped?

109
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,950
Waste precious tanks

110
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,269
when they can pick us off from
the air, like fish in a barrel?

111
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,943
How long does London expect the army

112
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:14,480
to hold out before we make terms?

113
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,483
Make terms?

114
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:20,069
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

115
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,948
Britain's next and then
the rest of the world.

116
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,034
Christ.

117
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,535
I mean, you can practically
see it from here.

118
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,663
What?

119
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,832
Home.

120
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,064
What about the French?

121
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:36,211
Publicly, Churchill's
told them, "Bras dessous."

122
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,142
Arm in arm, leaving together.

123
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:39,519
And privately?

124
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:41,882
We need our army back.

125
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,929
How many men are they
talking about, sir?

126
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:48,337
Churchill wants 30,000. Ramsay's
hoping we can give him 45.

127
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,400
There are 400,000 men
on this beach, sir.

128
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,356
We'll just have to do our best.

129
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,068
Right, well, this mole
stays open at all costs.

130
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:04,397
We're in artillery range from the
west. If anything else sinks here,

131
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,574
the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.

132
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,118
Can't we load from the beaches?

133
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:09,994
Better than standing out
here when the dive bombs come.

134
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,538
- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

135
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,580
'Cause anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

136
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,210
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

137
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,089
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

138
00:23:09,407 --> 00:23:10,598
Hey!

139
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,727
Hey! Can you swim it?

140
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,478
Dad, can you get closer?

141
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,941
Can't risk it!

142
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,734
Hang on.

143
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,576
What's your name?

144
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,097
Wreckage below.

145
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,223
Is it more of the 109?

146
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,683
No.

147
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,354
It's Fortis Leader. Over.

148
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,063
You think he got out?

149
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,501
I didn't see a 'chute.

150
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,984
Record his position.

151
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,362
Then set heading 128,

152
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,405
height 1,000. Over.

153
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,665
Vector 128, angels one. Understood.

154
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,875
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

155
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,876
50 gallons. Over.

156
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,626
50 gallons.

157
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,925
All right, keep letting me know.

158
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,721
My gauge took a bit
of a knock back there.

159
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,972
Shouldn't you turn back?

160
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,476
No, no.

161
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,479
I'm fairly confident
it's just the gauge.

162
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,902
- She's going down!
- Cut her loose!

163
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,069
What about the wounded?

164
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,659
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

165
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,661
Cut her loose, and push her off!

166
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,414
We can't let her sink at the mole!

167
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,959
Push the bloody boat off!

168
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,425
Help us!

169
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,790
Do you want to come below?

170
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,711
It's much warmer.

171
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,961
It's out of the wind.

172
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,382
Here you go.

173
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,842
Leave him be, George.

174
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,679
He feels safer on deck.

175
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,430
You would too if you'd been bombed.

176
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,432
U-boat.

177
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,938
It was a U-boat.

178
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,151
Get him some more tea, George.

179
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,625
Right, we're about five minutes out,

180
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,460
so climb to 2,000. Over.

181
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,536
That's more fuel.

182
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:17,248
I know, but I don't
want to get jumped again.

183
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,631
Let's get a decent altitude.

184
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,715
We can dive down on the
bastards from above. Over.

185
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,340
Understood. Angels two.

186
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,345
Over.

187
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,432
Right, Highlanders.

188
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,018
Let's find you another ship.

189
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,133
Come on.

190
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,261
Everyone else, keep
climbing. Climb on the deck.

191
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,516
Climb on the deck.

192
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,560
Watch your heads on the rail. Watch it.

193
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:57,270
That's right, keep going
down. Take a blanket.

194
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,190
Down you go. Put this on, my love.

195
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:02,234
Down you go. Keep going down.

196
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,528
There's a nice cup of
tea for you down there.

197
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,695
Keep moving down.

198
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,366
Take a blanket.

199
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,741
Try and make some room.

200
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,162
Keep moving down, boys.

201
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,580
This way.

202
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,540
A cup of tea down there.

203
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,987
There you go. Down
there. Move down there.

204
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:04,673
What's wrong with your friend?

205
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,346
He's looking for a quick way out.

206
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,115
In case we go down.

207
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,236
Where are we going?

208
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,740
Dunkirk.

209
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,868
No, uh, no, no, we're going to England.

210
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,121
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

211
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,999
Look, I'm not going back.

212
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:24,878
I'm not going back.

213
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,131
Look at it.

214
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,009
If we go there, we'll die.

215
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,183
I see your point, son.

216
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,144
Well, let's plot a course.

217
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,151
You can take your tea below and warm up.

218
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:52,445
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

219
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,865
Uh, yeah.

220
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,664
Here, come on.

221
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,046
Careful.

222
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:10,632
Careful.

223
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,266
Just in there.

224
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,476
I'll get you some more tea.

225
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,951
Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?

226
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,744
He's shell-shocked, George.

227
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,331
He's not himself.

228
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,461
He may never be himself again.

229
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,221
Here you are.

230
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,699
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

231
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,367
40 gallons, understood.

232
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,414
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

233
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,501
She's lining up to drop her
load on that minesweeper.

234
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:29,668
Fighters?

235
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,130
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

236
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,675
I'm on the bomber.

237
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,478
Got him! Got him!

238
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,010
Oh, she's turning. You
must've damaged her.

239
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,387
Where's the escort?

240
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,556
Well, I got one of...

241
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,224
Jesus!

242
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,452
I'm going down.

243
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,996
I'm on him. Bail out.

244
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,744
No, the swell looks good. I'm ditching.

245
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:11,831
Don't leave us!

246
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,875
Come back!

247
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,380
- Wait for us!
- Help! Help us!

248
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,635
Pick us up! Pick us up!

249
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,056
Come back!

250
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,768
Torpedo!

251
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,260
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

252
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:54,909
Help!

253
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,579
Get us out of here!

254
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,760
Spitfires, George.

255
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,099
Greatest plane ever built.

256
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,096
You didn't even look.

257
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,273
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

258
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,318
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.

259
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,112
Hello?

260
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,947
Could you open the door?

261
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,492
Hello? Can you hear me?

262
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,744
Open the door!

263
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,123
Do you hear me?

264
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,916
He wants to come out.

265
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,085
What have you done? Locked him in?

266
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,753
Let him out, for God's sake.

267
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,757
Hello?

268
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,385
Let me out!

269
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,525
You haven't turned around.

270
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,740
No. We have a job to do.

271
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:18,452
Job? This is a pleasure yacht.

272
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:21,248
You're weekend sailors,
not the bloody navy.

273
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,998
A man your age?

274
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,626
Men my age dictate this war.

275
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,503
Why should we be allowed to
send our children to fight it?

276
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,340
You should be at home!

277
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,126
Well, there won't be any home if we

278
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,014
allow a slaughter across the Channel.

279
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:44,101
He's turning tail. I'm
gonna get after him.

280
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,855
Good luck.

281
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,860
Watch your fuel. You're at 15 gallons.

282
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,947
15 gallons, understood.

283
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,617
Best of luck, Collins.

284
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,831
Collins, do you read?

285
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,976
Oi! No! No!

286
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,228
Get off! Get off!

287
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,231
Piss off, the both of
you. It's too crowded.

288
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,483
You can't leave us!

289
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,775
Make some room!

290
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,778
No!

291
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,155
No! Get off!

292
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:19,978
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.

293
00:44:19,981 --> 00:44:21,887
She's gone over twice
on the way out here.

294
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,039
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

295
00:44:24,043 --> 00:44:24,994
Calm?

296
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,789
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm!

297
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,248
You have life jackets?

298
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:30,751
Yes, they do.

299
00:44:30,753 --> 00:44:32,878
Don't panic, boys. The
water's not too rough

300
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,128
or too cold.

301
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,838
We're heading back to the beach.

302
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,092
- Let's go to Dover!
- Yeah!

303
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,815
We can't make it across
the Channel in this, lads.

304
00:44:40,818 --> 00:44:44,146
We need to get back to the
beach and wait for another ride.

305
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,434
You men in the water, float
here, save your strength.

306
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:49,143
We'll come back for you.

307
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:50,146
Oars in!

308
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:53,983
Together, pull!

309
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,528
Together, pull!

310
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:00,865
Pull!

311
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:04,077
Together, pull!

312
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,331
Pull!

313
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,376
Together, pull!

314
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,798
There's no hiding from this, son.

315
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,967
What is it you think you can
do out there, on this thing?

316
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,262
There's not just us. A call went out.

317
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,474
We aren't the only ones
to answer, you know.

318
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:29,518
You don't even have guns.

319
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,684
Do you have a gun?

320
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,605
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

321
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,652
Did it help you against the
dive bombers and the U-boats?

322
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,530
You're an old fool.

323
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,155
I'm not going back.

324
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,409
I'm not going back.

325
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,119
Turn it around.

326
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:48,621
I'm not turning round.

327
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,456
Turn it around!

328
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,000
Turn it...

329
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:57,045
- Calm it down, mate.
- Turn it around!

330
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,213
Wait, wait!

331
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,922
Calm it down, mate.

332
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,094
George?

333
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:03,929
George!

334
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,847
What have you done?

335
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:10,893
Okay, you're all right, George.

336
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:12,813
You're all right.

337
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,690
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

338
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:18,358
That's it. That's good enough.

339
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,445
It's gonna keep some
pressure on. There we go.

340
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,195
There we go.

341
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,449
Can you hear me, George?

342
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,561
Come on, lads!

343
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,610
Come on! Come on, boys!

344
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,277
It's a pier.

345
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:13,947
For when the water comes in.

346
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,869
The tide's turning now.

347
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:22,956
How can you tell?

348
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,876
The bodies come back.

349
00:51:57,699 --> 00:51:58,699
Hey.

350
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,713
Hey, Highlanders!

351
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:24,474
Hey, Highlanders!

352
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:25,684
What's that way?

353
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,518
A boat.

354
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:29,061
She's grounded.

355
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,148
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.

356
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:51,043
Be a brave lad.

357
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:55,047
You and Mr. Dawson?

358
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,532
It's the best thing I've ever done.

359
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,721
You're all right. You're okay.

360
00:53:12,532 --> 00:53:15,643
Sea Cadet. It's the only
thing I've ever done.

361
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:17,815
It's all right. It's
okay. Just have some water.

362
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,282
I told my dad...

363
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:24,452
I've done nothing at school

364
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,539
and that I would do something one day.

365
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,043
Maybe get in the local paper.

366
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,420
Maybe my teachers would see it.

367
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,965
Okay, get some rest.

368
00:53:37,969 --> 00:53:40,501
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

369
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:43,429
I can't.

370
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,384
What?

371
00:53:49,603 --> 00:53:50,936
I can't see.

372
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:51,873
Sir.

373
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:55,668
The French have been forced
back on the western side.

374
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,085
They're still holding a perimeter?

375
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:59,088
For now.

376
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:02,914
Officer coming through. Move
yourselves. Move yourselves!

377
00:55:13,297 --> 00:55:14,797
Where are the destroyers?

378
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,344
There'll be one soon.

379
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,025
One?

380
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,777
After yesterday's losses, it's
one ship on the mole at a time.

381
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,028
The battle is here.

382
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,697
What the hell are they saving them for?

383
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,324
The next battle.

384
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,951
The one for Britain.

385
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,913
It's the same with the planes.

386
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,666
But it's right there.

387
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:37,541
You can practically...

388
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,751
Seeing home doesn't help
us get there, Colonel.

389
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,715
They need to send more ships.

390
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,217
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

391
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,052
They've activated the
small vessels pool.

392
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,177
Small vessels?

393
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,139
It's the list of civilian
boats for requisition.

394
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,143
Civilian?

395
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,893
We need destroyers.

396
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,813
Small boats can load from the beach.

397
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:00,231
Not in these conditions.

398
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:02,735
Well, I'd rather face
waves than dive bombers.

399
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:08,449
No, you're right. They
won't get up in this.

400
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,744
The Royal Engineers are
building piers from lorries.

401
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:15,538
At least that should help
us when the tide comes back.

402
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,708
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.

403
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,190
I thought the tides were every three?

404
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:24,757
Then it's good that you're
army and I'm navy, isn't it?

405
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,510
There. Vanquisher.

406
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:44,692
Where's the crew?

407
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:47,360
Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

408
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:49,362
Scarpered up the beach.

409
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,530
Why?

410
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,744
'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

411
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:57,496
All right, best shut
ourselves inside, boys.

412
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,664
Wait for the high tide.

413
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,416
How long's that?

414
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,045
Every three hours.

415
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,860
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

416
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,822
Strapped him up, made him comfortable.

417
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,155
What?

418
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,411
It's bad, Dad.

419
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:39,916
Well, should we turn back?

420
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,297
We've come so far.

421
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:50,175
Dad, is that one of ours?

422
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:55,175
That's a Heinkel. They'll go
for that minesweeper there.

423
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:57,472
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand
by to pick up survivors?

424
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,351
To do that we have to survive ourselves.

425
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,275
Poke your head out. See
if the water's come in.

426
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,240
Talkative sod, aren't you?

427
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,309
It's barely come in at all.

428
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:43,643
- Fuck's sake.
- Calm down.

429
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,980
What goes out comes
back in again, right?

430
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,400
Yeah, but how long?

431
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,001
Spitfires!

432
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:06,920
Come on.

433
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,594
Come on, come on.

434
00:59:23,353 --> 00:59:24,851
Dad, he got him!

435
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,438
Yeah! Yeah!

436
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,322
The Heinkel's moving off.

437
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,454
Yeah.

438
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:44,081
Oh, no.

439
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,835
Smoke from the Spitfire!

440
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,005
Watch for a parachute!

441
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,045
Oi.

442
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,519
Oi. Oi.

443
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,065
Are you German?

444
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,525
No, Dutch. Dutch!

445
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:56,980
Merchant navy.

446
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,280
Here to pick you up. To help you.

447
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:01,114
Why'd you leave your boat?

448
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:02,367
In case the Germans come.

449
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:04,815
We wait up the beach.

450
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:07,038
With the soldiers. Wait for the tide.

451
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,333
You came back. The tide must be in.

452
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,668
Coming. Coming, yes.

453
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,836
But more hours till we float.

454
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,005
Hours?

455
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:17,590
Why'd you come back?

456
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:20,552
Not so heavy when I left.

457
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,400
No 'chute!

458
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,088
Best of luck, Collins.

459
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:48,873
Collins, do you read?

460
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,025
He's down.

461
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:00,317
Dad.

462
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,528
Dad, watch the engine.

463
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:04,865
Dad, he's down. There was no 'chute.

464
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:10,739
Dad, come on. There was no 'chute.

465
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,663
He's probably dead.

466
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,833
Damn it, I hear you, Peter! I hear you!

467
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,880
He may be alive. Maybe.

468
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,759
We may be able to help him.

469
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:19,771
No! Then they'll know we're in here.

470
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,773
Why else are they shooting at us?

471
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,318
Look at the grouping.

472
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,615
Target practice.

473
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:33,264
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

474
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:54,949
We have to plug it.

475
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:57,161
After you, mate.

476
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,186
You ready? Go!

477
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,775
How do we get off? Do we
need to ditch some ballast?

478
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:29,735
Weight! Do we need to lose weight?

479
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,653
Weight. Weight, yes.

480
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,155
Yes.

481
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,532
Somebody needs to get off.

482
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:37,159
Well volunteered.

483
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,161
We don't need a volunteer.

484
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,789
I know someone who ought to get off.

485
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,251
This one.

486
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,043
He's a German spy.

487
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,586
Don't be daft.

488
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,132
He's a fucking Jerry.

489
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,094
Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

490
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:55,971
'Cause I have.

491
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,012
He don't speak English.

492
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,349
If he does it's with an accent
that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.

493
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,601
You're daft. Tell him.

494
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:04,813
Yeah.

495
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,610
Tell me.

496
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:36,971
Tell me, Gibson.

497
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,021
Tell me!

498
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:48,606
Tell him, for God's sake!

499
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,532
A frog.

500
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,077
A bloody frog.

501
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:04,914
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.

502
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,123
Who's Gibson, eh?

503
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:09,614
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

504
01:08:09,617 --> 01:08:11,503
Did you at least have
the decency to bury him?

505
01:08:11,507 --> 01:08:13,659
He did. I helped him. I
thought it was his mate.

506
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:15,382
- Maybe he killed him.
- He didn't kill him.

507
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:16,550
How do we know?

508
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,136
How hard is it to find a dead
Englishman on Dunkirk beach?

509
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,554
He didn't kill anyone.

510
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:23,076
He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

511
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,021
Haven't they had enough practice by now?

512
01:08:30,024 --> 01:08:32,190
They're trying to make
sure she won't float.

513
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:33,859
Will she still float?

514
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,654
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

515
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:38,529
And we know who's getting off.

516
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:40,823
No, you can't do that. He's
French. He's on our side.

517
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,493
Go on. Up you go.

518
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,912
As soon as he pokes his head
out, they'll slaughter him.

519
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,329
Better him than me.

520
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:47,663
It's not fair.

521
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,123
Survival's not fair.

522
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,246
No, it's shit.

523
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,503
It's fear, and it's greed.

524
01:08:53,506 --> 01:08:55,671
Fate pushed through the bowels of men.

525
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:56,675
Shit.

526
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,592
He saved our lives.

527
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:01,011
And he's about to do it again.

528
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,132
No, don't! Stop!

529
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:06,769
Somebody's gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

530
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,726
If you wanna volunteer...

531
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,145
Fuck no.

532
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,148
I'm going home.

533
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,484
And if this is the price?

534
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:19,614
I'll live with it.

535
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,242
But it's wrong.

536
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,034
Go on!

537
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,287
One man's not going to
make enough difference.

538
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,649
You'd best hope it does, because
you'd be volunteering next.

539
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:31,543
What?

540
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,296
We're regimental brothers, mate.

541
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,297
It's just the way it is.

542
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,685
We float!

543
01:09:48,394 --> 01:09:49,520
We float!

544
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,814
Start the bloody engine!

545
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:31,604
Afternoon.

546
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:29,328
I'm sorry, son. I really don't know.

547
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,748
You're right not moving him.

548
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:38,837
You've done the best for him you can.

549
01:11:50,694 --> 01:11:52,265
We've wasted the day.

550
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,310
I share your frustration, Colonel.

551
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:56,854
Johnny!

552
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,904
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

553
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,949
They're breaking through
the dunes to the east.

554
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,162
This is it.

555
01:12:21,255 --> 01:12:22,503
Plug the holes!

556
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:23,798
With what?

557
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:36,603
Plug the holes!

558
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,149
Other side! Other side!

559
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,408
What do you see?

560
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,626
Home.

561
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,201
Is he all right? The boy?

562
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:40,618
No.

563
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:42,288
No, he's not.

564
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:54,717
Dad!

565
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,895
Come on. Come on, Farrier. Come on.

566
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:25,457
There's men in the water!

567
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:11,795
Oil.

568
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:15,756
It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil!

569
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,668
Keep coming.

570
01:17:53,587 --> 01:17:55,086
Plenty of room.

571
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:01,845
All right, below deck.

572
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,800
Abandon ship!

573
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:04,365
Gibson! Leave it!

574
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:48,534
Below decks.

575
01:20:36,988 --> 01:20:39,792
Listen, we have to get as
many of you on board as we can

576
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,085
before that oil catches fire.

577
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,715
You go below decks or you get
off my boat. That's your choice.

578
01:20:46,635 --> 01:20:48,386
Keep coming.

579
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,387
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Careful!
Careful down there!

580
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,682
Careful! Careful down there!

581
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,854
He's dead, mate.

582
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:04,569
So be bloody careful with him.

583
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:28,260
Um, will he be okay?

584
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,095
The boy?

585
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:37,060
Yeah.

586
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,561
He's coming back round.

587
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:05,229
He's coming back round!

588
01:23:10,612 --> 01:23:12,529
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

589
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:29,337
Get off the ship!

590
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:46,813
Come on, Farrier. Get around them.

591
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,108
Come on, come on.

592
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:45,789
Go.

593
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:51,296
Go! Go! Go!

594
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:06,770
Go!

595
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,554
Easy.

596
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:47,935
Take me home.

597
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:47,119
Where are you from?

598
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,996
Out of Dartmouth!

599
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:51,248
Christ.

600
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,832
You from Deal?

601
01:26:53,835 --> 01:26:55,458
I am!

602
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,795
You watch the current at the mouth!

603
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:58,962
Aye.

604
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:00,048
And thank you!

605
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:51,056
That's a fighter.

606
01:27:51,059 --> 01:27:52,390
Yes, an Me 109.

607
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,560
From the south. Peter,
you take the tiller.

608
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,396
Listen for my instructions.

609
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,440
Point her south!

610
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,079
Full speed, Peter.

611
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:16,122
Keep coming round.

612
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:17,335
Keep coming.

613
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:22,340
Before he fires, he's gotta drop
his nose. I'll give you the signal.

614
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:25,051
- Now?
- No, no. Wait.

615
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,304
Wait for him to commit to his line.

616
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,572
Now!

617
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:25,900
He's gone.

618
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:27,403
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

619
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,697
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?

620
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:30,908
My son's one of you lot.

621
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:33,411
I knew he'd see us through.

622
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:40,460
You're RAF?

623
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,545
No. Not me.

624
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:48,048
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

625
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:49,635
Died third week into the war.

626
01:30:29,884 --> 01:30:31,969
No, stay downstairs, please.

627
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,596
We just wanna see the cliffs.

628
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,020
- Is it Dover?
- No.

629
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:46,023
That's Dorset.

630
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:47,568
But it's home.

631
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:52,030
We let you all down, didn't we?

632
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:34,239
Christ, how many you got in there?

633
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:53,885
Make your way to the trains.

634
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,137
Where the hell were you?

635
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:06,271
They know where you were.

636
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,528
Bye.

637
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,716
Cup of tea?

638
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,011
Cup of tea?

639
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:41,012
Well done. Well done.

640
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:42,305
Well done, lads.

641
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,717
Well done. Well done, lads.

642
01:32:45,871 --> 01:32:48,037
Well done.

643
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,708
All we did is survive.

644
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:51,810
That's enough.

645
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:00,773
Well done.

646
01:33:01,703 --> 01:33:02,997
Well done.

647
01:33:14,198 --> 01:33:16,659
That old bloke wouldn't
even look us in the eye.

648
01:33:36,966 --> 01:33:38,885
Come on, private!

649
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:44,578
I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

650
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:47,998
So now is not the time to be particular.

651
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,225
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

652
01:33:54,235 --> 01:33:55,529
And then some.

653
01:33:56,377 --> 01:33:58,463
Almost 300,000.

654
01:34:01,884 --> 01:34:03,135
So far.

655
01:34:04,724 --> 01:34:06,148
So far?

656
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:07,402
I'm staying.

657
01:34:08,587 --> 01:34:09,962
For the French.

658
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:05,282
Hey!

659
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:06,617
Where are we?

660
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:09,578
Siding. You'll be
pulling in in a minute.

661
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,204
What station?

662
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:12,707
Woking.

663
01:35:13,252 --> 01:35:15,208
Grab me one of them papers.

664
01:35:15,211 --> 01:35:16,337
Go on!

665
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:31,601
Can't bear it.

666
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:34,604
You read it.

667
01:35:35,398 --> 01:35:36,399
Can't bear it?

668
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:39,234
They'll be spitting
at us in the streets.

669
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:42,886
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

670
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,801
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

671
01:36:35,768 --> 01:36:37,623
I can't look.

672
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,792
"But there was a victory
inside this deliverance,"

673
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,795
which should be noted."

674
01:36:48,377 --> 01:36:50,416
"Our thankfulness at
the escape of our army"

675
01:36:50,418 --> 01:36:52,912
must not blind us to the
fact that what has happened

676
01:36:52,916 --> 01:36:57,273
in France and Belgium is a
colossal military disaster.

677
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:17,750
We must expect another blow to
be struck almost immediately.

678
01:37:36,644 --> 01:37:38,354
We shall go on to the end.

679
01:37:42,358 --> 01:37:44,275
We shall fight in France.

680
01:37:45,778 --> 01:37:48,279
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

681
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:06,840
We shall fight with growing confidence
and growing strength in the air.

682
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:16,417
We shall defend our island
whatever the cost..."

683
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:17,431
What?

684
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:20,978
"We shall defend our island
whatever the cost may be.

685
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:23,188
We shall fight on the beaches.

686
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,814
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

687
01:38:24,817 --> 01:38:26,984
We shall fight in the
fields and in the streets.

688
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:28,145
We shall fight in the hills.

689
01:38:29,363 --> 01:38:31,030
We shall never surrender.

690
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:45,793
And even if this island
or a large part of it

691
01:38:45,796 --> 01:38:47,712
were subjugated and starving,

692
01:38:47,715 --> 01:38:51,966
then our Empire beyond the seas,
armed and guarded by the British Fleet,

693
01:38:51,969 --> 01:38:54,427
would carry on the struggle

694
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:57,514
until, in God's good time,

695
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,662
the New World, with
all its power and might,

696
01:38:59,664 --> 01:39:03,114
steps forth to the rescue and
the liberation of the old."

697
01:39:17,033 --> 01:39:20,246
